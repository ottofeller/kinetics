# Kinetics
Kinetics is a hosting platform for Rust applications that allows you to deploy all types of workloads by writing **only Rust code**.

```rust
#[endpoint(
    url_path = "/path",
    environment = {"SOME_VAR": "SomeVal"},
)]
pub async fn endpoint(
    _event: Request,
    _secrets: &HashMap<String, String>,
) -> Result<Response<Body>, Error> {
    let resp = Response::builder()
        .status(200)
        .header("content-type", "text/html")
        .body("Hello!".into())?;

    Ok(resp)
}
```

## Features

ü¶Ä **Only Rust code required**

Just apply attribute macro to your function, and Kinetics will handle the rest. No other tools required.

üöÄ **Supports any workload**

Deploy REST API endpoints, queue workers, and cron jobs.

ü§ñ **No infrastructure management**

The infrastructure is provisioned automatically, e.g. a queue for the worker workload.

üíø **Comes with DB**

Seamlessly provision KV DB if your workload needs a persistent storage.

üîë **Secrets**

Automatically provision secrets from `.env.secrets` file.

üåç **CDN**

REST API endpoints are served through a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

## Examples

Check out complete ready-to-use [examples](https://github.com/kinetics-dev/examples). There are examples for REST API endpoints, queue workers, and cron jobs.

## Try it
```bash
# 1. Install
cargo install kinetics

# 2. Login
cargo kinetics login <email>

# 3. Apply one of attribute macro
# E.g. add #[endpoint()] to your function

# 4. Deploy
# Run in the dir of your crate
cargo kinetics deploy

# 5. Test it with curl
curl <URL from cargo kinetics deploy>
```

Kinetics is currently in ‚ö†Ô∏è **active development** and may contain bugs or result in unexpected behavior. The service is free for the first **100,000 invocations** of your functions, regardless of the type of workload.

If you have any issues, please contact us at support@usekinetics.com.

## Documentation

All configuration can be done through attribute macro parameters, or through modifications to existing `Cargo.toml` file in your project. All types of workloads support environment variables. These can be changed **without redeploying** (this feature is WIP).

#### Endpoint
The following attribute macro parameters are available:

- `url_path`: The URL path of the endpoint.
- `environment`: Environment variables.

#### Worker
Attribute macro parameters:

- `concurrency`: Max number of concurrent workers.
- `fifo`: Set to true to enable FIFO processing.
- `environment`: Environment variables.

#### Cron
Attribute macro parameters:

- `schedule`: [Schedule expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-scheduler-schedule.html#cfn-scheduler-schedule-scheduleexpression).
- `environment`: Environment variables.

#### Secrets
Store secrets in `.env.secrets` file in the root directory of your crate. Kinetics will automatically pick it up and provision to all of your workloads in the second parameter of the function as `HashMap<String, String>`.

Example:
```
# .env.secrets
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```rust
#[endpoint()]
pub async fn endpoint(
    event: Request,
    secrets: &HashMap<String, String>,
) -> Result<Response<Body>, Error> {
    println!("API key: {}", secrets.get("API_KEY").unwrap());
```

#### Database
Database is defined in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[package.metadata.kinetics.kvdb.test]
# You will need this name to connect to the database
# If not defined then the resource name from above will be used as DB name
name = "test"
```

Connect to the database (we provision AWS DynamoDB) using the name defined in `Cargo.toml`:

```rust
#[endpoint()]
pub async fn endpoint(
    event: Request,
    secrets: &HashMap<String, String>,
) -> Result<Response<Body>, Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_defaults(aws_config::BehaviorVersion::latest()).await;
    let client = Client::new(&config);

    client
        .get_item()
        .table_name("test")
        .key("id", AttributeValue::S("id"))
        .send()
        .await?;
```
